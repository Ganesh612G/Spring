**Ambiguity**
**Primary Bean Declaration**
Mark one bean as the default choice by using the @Primary annotation. This tells Spring to prefer that bean when multiple candidates are found.

**Qualifier Annotation**
Use the @Qualifier annotation to explicitly specify which bean should be injected. This is helpful when different beans serve different purposes and need to be distinguished.

**Custom Bean Names**
Assign specific names to beans and reference them by name when injecting, ensuring thereâ€™s no confusion.

**Profile-Specific Beans**
Define beans for specific profiles using the @Profile annotation, ensuring that only one set of beans is active in a particular environment.

**Java Configuration with Explicit Definitions**
Explicitly define and qualify beans in a @Configuration class, giving full control over bean creation and injection.

**Use of Factory Methods**
When ambiguity is unavoidable, create factory methods that resolve which bean to provide at runtime.
